The programs were programmed in python 2.7.12

These programs build decision trees usin gthe ID3 algorithm.
The goal is to try and predict whether a room is occupied by taking
into consideration the temperature, humidity, light and CO2 in the room.

The program in tree.py has been optimized to efficiently build a decision tree in less
than 1 minute using more than 20,000 points of data.

part_b.py and part_c.py are exercises in cross validation to try and find the optimal
max_depth of a tree to avoid overfitting.

I was able to finish the cross-validation programs within 5 minutes on
my own personal computer.
